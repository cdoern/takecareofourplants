# takecareofourplants
code for the reddit bots on r/takecareofourplants 
This project was inspired by r/takecareofmyplant which has come to a sad and bittersweet end. The community, however, lives on in a subbreddit I created named r/takecareofourplants. This code is the sole file for the bot u/takecareofourplants. The purpose of this community is to inspire people to start their own projects and bots to further this communities reach and complexity. We are all, pretty bad at taking care of our plants!
